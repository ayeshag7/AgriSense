# AgriSense  
AI-Powered Precision Agriculture Ecosystem  

AgriSense is an advanced precision agriculture ecosystem developed as part of a Final Year Project at Namal University. This project leverages autonomous drones, IoT sensors, and AI technologies to promote sustainable farming practices by enhancing productivity, optimizing resource usage, and providing actionable insights to farmers.  

## Features  
- **Crop Health Monitoring:** Real-time detection of crop health issues using object detection models (YOLOv10, Faster R-CNN).  
- **Irrigation Optimization:** Reducing water wastage with IoT-driven monitoring and analysis.  
- **Yield Estimation:** Predicting crop yields with machine learning models.  
- **Edge Computing:** Real-time data processing using Raspberry Pi and drone integration.  
- **Cloud Infrastructure:** Secure data storage and management with Google Cloud IoT Core.
